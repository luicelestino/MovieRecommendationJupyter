## Movie Recommender
Created a movie recommender app using Jupyter notebook that takes in user input to search for a movie.
The app will then output a list of movies that it recommends based on other users in the database that have similar preferences to the current user.
The system used user-based collaborative filtering and utilized cosine similarity scores to compute the similarity between the movie entered and the movies in the database.

Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
